BRAINSTORMING
what if right to left numbers
how many times you click a button, maybe even a color button 
is what gives the number, but maybe the button is moving
( use CSS animations)

or the numbers are there, but it's white text on a white background
"good luck finding the numbers, click if u do"

good bad ideas here: https://blog.codepen.io/2016/11/03/ridiculous-ways-enter-phone-number-form/


impossible to click button tutorial: https://youtu.be/Cy6ALx6gx9w?si=KWfiG6AWxDj6hm8V

like the bouncing balls one but each ball is a button with number

cursor gets blown away as it tries to reach button
Using setTimeout to delay hover actions in JavaScript:
https://codelair.com/javascript/settimeout-delay-hover-javascript/

could make a dark room, ur cursor is the flashlight to find numbers

hehheeeee yesssss and the numbers r mooooving

so bouncing balls but each ball is a button with a number

to find the numbers

12/12 CRITIQUE
beep boop bop bap
make submit button with entered phone number
maybe ask samritha? or anna chester whats their name how they did the moving buttons
stop after 10th number clicked, or unclickable button if less than 10 numbers inputted
clear/reset button

made the button move and click, turned off light for now

- make all the buttons move & associate with a number
- save clicks to phone number
- check if phone number is more than 10 digits and put submit button if true
- clear button
