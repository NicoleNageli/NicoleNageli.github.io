    <h2>Page 1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <dl>
            <li>added page 5 to nav bar</li>
                <dd>
                    Technically not an error, but I wanted to add page 5 to the nav bar.
                </dd>
                <br>
            <li>added 'lang' to html tag</li>
                <dd>
                    The html tag was written as '&lt;html&gt;' and was missing the lang global attribute. The lang global attribute is used to identify the language of the website's content.
                </dd>
                <br>
            <li>added closing tag</li>
                <dd>
                    Line 22 was missing the closing tag for the list element.
                </dd>
                <br>
            <li>fixed nested paragraph</li>
                <dd>
                    Line 28's nested paragraph wasn't properly nested inside the div tag. So, a set of opening and closing p tags were added inside the div tag.
                </dd>
                <br>
            <li>added closing table data tag</li>
                <dd>
                    Line 36 was missing a closing table data tag.
                </dd>
                <br>
            <li>added closing table row tag</li>
                <dd>
                    Line 42 was missing a closing table row tag.
                </dd>
                <br>
            <li>added closing table tag</li>
                <dd>
                    Line 43 was missing a closing table tag.
                </dd>
                <br>
        </dl>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 2</h2>
    <ul>
        <dl>
            <li>bolded key words in paragraph</li>
                <dd>
                    Line 27 was missing the proper tags for bolding 'New Beehive Inn' and didn't have a proper closing tag. I added a set of &lt;b&gt; tags.
                </dd>
                <br>
            <li>changed nesting of bold and header tag</li>
                <dd>
                    For line 53, the error said "Element h2 not allowed as child of element b". I could have taken out the bold tags, but I just moved them from the outside to inside the header tag.
                </dd>
                <br>
            <li>added proper link</li>
                <dd>
                    For line 57, the error said "Bad value where do i go for attribute href on element a" because it's not a link. To fix this, I put a wikipedia link to a segmental arch.
                </dd>
                <br>
            <li>added closing header tag</li>
                <dd>
                    This error: "Element hr not allowed as child of element h6" was around the horizontal rule tag becuase there wasn't a closing h6 tag in the previous line.
                </dd>
                <br>
        </dl>
    </ul>

                <dd>
                    Technically not an error, but I wanted to add page 5 to the nav bar.
                </dd>
                <br>
            <li>added global lang attribute</li>
                <dd>
                    The html tag was written as '&lt;html&gt;' and was missing the lang global attribute. The lang global attribute is used to identify the language of the website's content.
                </dd>
                <br>
            <li>added !DOCTYPE html tag</li>
                <dd>
                    The !DOCTYPE html tag was missing so I added it.

                <br>
            <li>adding meta, title, and link to css stylesheet</li>
                <dd>
                    I added the meta charset and name, title tags with 'Mid-term Page 3', and an external linked css stylesheet linking to the cars.css file in the css folder.
                </dd>
                <br>

                <dd>
