    <h3 id="History">History</h3>
        <p>
            <a href=""target="_blank"><em>Barney & Friends</em></a> first aired in 1992, gaining popularity among viewers under the age of four, but also garnering disapproval by most older children and young adults, who criticized it for being "saccharine", "sunshine-and-flowers", "rainbows", and "one-dimensional". These children were among the first to practice anti-Barney humor.

                Charles Barkley was the guest host of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live" target="_blank">Saturday Night Live</a> on September 25, 1993, and performed a skit that parodied his Godzilla-themed Nike commercial by facing off against Barney in a one-on-one matchup.

                The Barney Fun Page is an early website that allows users to attack a crude drawing of Barney with icons representing a knife, gun, and other weapons. Hosted originally on a University of Alberta computer system, the website was created in 1994. It is among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_founded_before_1995"target="_blank">the oldest websites in the world</a> still operating as of 2022.

            <p>
                Lyons Partnership, owners of the intellectual property rights to <a href=""target="_blank"><em>Barney & Friends</em></a>, claimed that some Barney spoofs that employed photos of the character or parody sound files represented trademark and copyright infringement. Lyons' lawyers subsequently demanded that such material be removed from the Internet. Some site owners complied after such threats,[49][50][51] but American law establishes parody as a fair use defense against such infringement claims.
